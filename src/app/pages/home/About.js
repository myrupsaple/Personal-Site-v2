                I am a full-stack web developer who is passionate about <u>programming</u> and <u>education</u>.
                I enjoy learning new things and finding ways to innovate and improve existing processes.
                For the past three and a half years, I have been fortunate enough to work at learning centers
                that allowed me to pursue both programming and education simultaneously. I recently decided
                that it was time to move on in my career, and am <u>currently seeking employment</u>.
